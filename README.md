## 📌 Project Overview

As Canada's senior population continues to grow, the need for affordable and accessible long-term care (LTC) housing becomes more urgent. Our capstone project aimed to analyze this issue using data-driven approaches and identify gaps in Ontario's current LTC infrastructure.

We focused on:
- Estimating future demand for LTC facilities
- Analyzing current availability and affordability
- Identifying regions with the greatest need

- The 65–69 age group is the largest, indicating an aging wave entering retirement age.

### ✅ Availability of Long-Term Care:
- **627 LTC homes** with **79,870 licensed beds** exist in Ontario.
- Only **30.25 beds per 1,000 seniors**, causing an average **waitlist of 288 seniors per facility**.

### ✅ Affordability Gap:
- **Average income of seniors (65+):** $2,390/month  
- **Average LTC rent in Ontario:** $3,588/month
